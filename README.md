# Footwork

**Learning AI engineering through music. Digital meets analog.**

## The Vision

Building two AI systems that understand complementary musical energies:
- **Digital Bot** (Yang): Van Halen-style hard rock
- **Analog Bot** (Yin): Diana Krall/Michael Franks smooth jazz

Then making them cover each other's songs.

The repository documents the journey from discrete steps (commits) 
to continuous flow (mastery). The footwork between the samples is 
where the learning lives.

## Month 1: Understanding the Poles

Analyzing two ice cream songs:
- "Ice Cream Man" (Van Halen) - analog, flowing, continuous
- "Popsicle Toes" (Michael Franks/Diana Krall) - digital, discrete, frozen

## Current Phase
Data collection and exploratory analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Progress
- [x] Repository created
- [ ] Collect anchor songs (Ice Cream Man + Popsicle Toes)
- [ ] Initial comparative analysis
- [ ] Lyric analysis
- [ ] Musical feature extraction
- [ ] First blog post

## The Journey

This is a 6-month progression from Python basics to production AI systems.
Each commit is a discrete step. The learning between commits is the footwork.
